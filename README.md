# Tyler BoddySpargo's Personal Website

This is a sample of my skills with Require.js, AngularJS, Sassy CSS, and JavaScript (modules and frameworks like spark-scroll and ScrollMagic) as well as an overview of various other projects and a summary of my professional and educational background.

# Requirements
See package.json

# Usage

## Compile
Before the site is functional, you'll need to compile the CSS using `sass` and move vendor JS files into place. You can accomplish this with the `npm run build` command (script is defined in `package.json`).
## Serve locally
This project uses firebase local hosting server
```bash
firebase server --only hosting
```

This is also the default action of the `npm start` script.
